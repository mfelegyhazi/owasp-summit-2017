# Internal Meetups

Use a format similar to [MeetUps](https://meetup.com) where a mentor (e.g. Security
Champion) goes through one topic per session. A monthly schedule should
be maintained to keep up the community-aspect of this format.

Meetup mentoring can be Security Champions or external experts, like external instructors.
Create an app for the hackathons similar to WebGoat.
